ImmerseAR: Image-Triggered AR Learning

Project Overview:

ImmerseAR takes virtual learning to the next level by seamlessly blending the physical and digital worlds. Our AR application lets you unleash 3D models of ships, cars, planes, and more simply by scanning their images found in books, magazines, or even online! Dive deep into the intricacies of these objects, rotating them 360Â° and exploring every detail in the comfort of your own space.

Key Features:

Image Recognition: Scan any relevant image, and watch as the corresponding 3D model instantly pops up in augmented reality.
Interactive Exploration: Manipulate the models in real-time using touch gestures. Rotate, zoom in and out, and take snapshots for closer study. 
Learning Content: Access additional information about the object directly within the app, including facts, diagrams, and interactive quizzes. 
Multi-Object Discovery: Scan multiple images to bring a whole scene to life! Explore the relationships between objects and create your own immersive learning environment. 
Customization: Choose from a variety of pre-loaded models or upload your own 3D creations for personalized learning experiences.

Tech Stack:

Programming Language(s): Unity 
AR Framework: Vuforia

Current Status:

ImmerseAR is actively under development, with a functional prototype showcasing image recognition and basic 3D model interaction. We are currently focusing on expanding the model library, enriching learning content, and optimizing image recognition accuracy.
